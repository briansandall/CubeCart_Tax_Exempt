# CubeCart_Tax_Exempt
Tax Exempt plugin for CubeCart v6

Specified customer groups will not have any tax applied to their orders nor see any tax information during the checkout process.

An additional tab is available when editing a customer that belongs to a tax exempt group allowing you to specify a tax exemption expiration date, for example if they have a resale certificate.
